## v4.4.0 (17/06/2022)
### :warning: Breaking Changes
Solr 7.7 reached EOL meaning that is no longer supported and will not receive any security patches. As such RODA from version 4.4 onward will use Solr 8 as index system. If you have any implementation with Solr 7 you need to upgrade the Solr to version 8 and then rebuild all indexes on RODA.

#### New features:

- Upgrade Solr version from 7.7 to Solr 8.11.1
- Upgrade GWT version from 2.9.0 to 2.10.0
